# hello-world
This is my first attempt at coding
I am a legal practitioner who self taught herself Python while at university. 
Sadly, my python skills were lost due to lack of practice and focus on my legal career. 
I have decided to re-learn everything I lost becuase of a realisation that I no longer enjoy my life as a legal practitioner, or perhaps, I want more out of life.
